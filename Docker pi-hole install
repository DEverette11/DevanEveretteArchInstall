INSTALLING DOCKER
# sudo apt update
This command updates apt
# sudo apt install docker.io
This command installs docker (not compose) in order for us to use it
# sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
This command doesn't work due to curl not being installed so I install curl next in order for it to work
# sudo apt install curl
This command installs curl onto my ubuntu vm
# sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Now this command work successfully
# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
This command allows docker-compose to execute files
INSTALLING PI-HOLE
(Guided by https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-your-own-secure-home-network-using-pi-hole-and-docker/ )
# sudo systemctl start docker
This starts the docker application for me to start pulling pihole
# sudo docker pull pihole/pihole
This pulls pihole using docker
# sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service
# sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
These stops the resolved system service in order for docker compose to work successfully 
# sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
# sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
These commands disables the same services we just stopped in order for docker compose to work 
# sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
In this file, we turned dns to 8.8.8.8 in order for pihole to work correctly
# sudo nano docker-compose.yml
On step 4 in the website, I copied and pasted the lines of code and information into the docker-compose.yml file
# sudo docker-compose up -d
This launches pihole file 
# sudo docker exec -it pihole bash
This command moves us into the pihole container for us to start it
# pihole -a -p
Set the password for pihole account
After setting the pihole account password, I went to http://localhost/admin/ to see if the pihole installed correctly, and which I see the pihole screen, indicating that it installed correctly
I will include the screenshot of the pihole interface with the submission.
